# probability_of_default_model

#### Data:
* Data Provided by: Moodys
* Data volume: Annual loan rating transitions from 1998 to 2016

#### Purpose:
Developed probability of default model on loan portfolios using a conditional rating transition-based approach to estimate probability of default for loans under various macroeconomic conditions.

#### Steps:
1. Z score calculation under the assumption of risk migrations following Markov Chain process
2. Variable selection using univariate analysis
3. Model selection using diagnostic tests to ensure model performance and conceptual soundness
4. Model implementation
